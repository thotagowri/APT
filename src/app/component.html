<!--What is Lorem Ipsum?-->
<!--Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's-->
<!--standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a-->
<!--type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining-->
<!--essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum-->
<!--passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.-->

<!--Why do we use it?-->
<!--It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its-->
<!--layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to-->
<!--using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web-->
<!--page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web-->
<!--sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on-->
<!--purpose (injected humour and the like).-->
